^This is Haneke, an open source iOS cache library for Swift and Objective-C.

---

# Lightweight *generic* cache for iOS

```swift
let cache = Cache<JSON>(name: "github")

let URLString = "https://api.github.com/users/haneke"
let URL = NSURL(string: URLString)!
    
cache.fetch(URL: URL).onSuccess { JSON in
   println(JSON.dictionary?["bio"])
}
```

^ It's designed to be super-simple to use. Here's how you would initalize a JSON cache and fetch objects from a url.

---

# Cache all the types!

Memory and LRU disk cache for:

* `UIImage`
* `NSData`
* `JSON`
* `String`
* Or any other type that can be read or written as data

---

#Features

* Generic cache with out-of-the-box support for `UIImage`, `NSData`, `JSON` and `String`
* First-level memory cache using `NSCache`
* Second-level LRU disk cache using the file system
* Asynchronous fetching from network or disk

---

#More features

* All disk access is performed in background
* Thread-safe
* Automatic cache eviction on memory warnings or when the disk capacity is reached

--- 

# Image features

* Zero-config `UIImageView` and `UIButton` extensions
* Optimized for `UITableView` and `UICollectionView` cell reuse
* Background image resizing and decompression

<br>


```swift
imageView.hnk_setImageFromURL(url)
```

---

#Meta-features

* Convention over configuration
* Comprehensive unit tests
* Extensible
* Easy debugging
* ~~Fully documented~~

---

# Requirements

Zero stress policy:

- iOS 8.0+
- Xcode 6.1


---

#Using the cache

```Swift
let cache = Haneke.sharedDataCache
        
cache.set(value: data, key: "funny-games.mp4")
        
// Eventually...

cache.fetch(key: "funny-games.mp4").onSuccess { data in
    // Do something with data
}
```

---

# Fetching

Fetch operation can also set if a source is provided.

```Swift
let cache = Haneke.sharedJSONCache

let URLString = "https://api.github.com/users/haneke"
let URL = NSURL(string: URLString)!
    
cache.fetch(URL: URL).onSuccess { JSON in
   println(JSON.dictionary?["bio"])
}
```

---

```Swift
cache.fetch(URL: URL).onSuccess { JSON in }
```

1. Fetch the required JSON from (in order) memory, disk or `NSURLCache`. 
2. If not available, fetch the JSON from the url, parse it and return it asynchronously.
3. And immediately afterwards cache the JSON in background.

---

##Extra â™¡ for images

Smart UIKit categories.

```swift
// Setting a remote image
imageView.hnk_setImageFromURL(url)

// Setting an image manually. Requires you to provide a key.
imageView.hnk_setImage(image, key: key)
```

---

The above lines take care of:

* *If cached*, retrieving an *appropriately sized image* from the memory or disk cache (in background).
* *If not cached*, loading the original from its source and producing an appropriately sized image (both in background). 
* Remote images will also be retrieved from the shared `NSURLCache` if available.

---

Then:

* Setting the image and animating the change if appropriate.
* Or doing nothing if the `UIImageView` was reused during any of the above steps.
* Caching the resulting image.
* If needed, evicting the least recently used images in the cache.

---

# If you need more control

```Swift
public func hnk_setImageFromURL(URL: NSURL, 
	placeholder : UIImage? = nil, 
	format : Format<UIImage>? = nil, 
	failure fail : ((NSError?) -> ())? = nil, 
	success succeed : ((UIImage) -> ())? = nil) { 
... 
}
```

---

# Extending Haneke

## Formats
## Fetchers
## Adding types

---

#Formats

Allow transformations to the values before being cached. 

For example, the `UIImageView` extension uses a format that resizes images to fit or fill the image view as needed.

---

# Format example

```swift
let cache = Haneke.sharedImageCache

let iconFormat = Format<UIImage>(name: "icons") { image in
    return imageByRoundingCornersOfImage(image)
}
cache.addFormat(iconFormat)

let URL = NSURL(string: "http://haneke.io/icon.png")!
cache.fetch(URL: URL, formatName: "icons").onSuccess { image in
    // image will be a nice rounded icon
}
```

---

Formats can also be used from the `UIKit` extensions:

```swift
imageView.hnk_setImageFromURL(url, format: iconFormat)
```

---

##Fetchers

The `fetch` functions for urls and paths are actually convenience methods. 

Under the hood Haneke uses fetcher objects:

```swift
let URL = NSURL(string: "http://haneke.io/icon.png")!

let fetcher = NetworkFetcher<UIImage>(URL: URL)
cache.fetch(fetcher: fetcher).onSuccess { image in
    // Do something with image
}
```
---

Two specialized fetchers: 

* `NetworkFetcher<T>`
* `DiskFetcher<T>`. 

You can also implement your own fetchers by subclassing `Fetcher<T>`.

---

#Custom fetchers

Fetch original values from other sources than network or disk (e.g., Core Data)

Or even change how Haneke acceses network or disk (e.g., use [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) for networking instead of `NSURLSession`). 

---

# Implementing custom fetchers

A custom fetcher must subclass `Fetcher<T>`. Responsibilities:

* Providing the key associated with the value to be fetched (e.g., `NSURL.absoluteString` in the case of `NetworkFetcher`)
* Fetching the value in background and calling the success or failure closure (both in the main queue)
* Cancelling the fetch on demand, if possible

Type restriction: must implement `DataConvertible`. 

---

#Supporting additional types

By implementing protocols:

```Swift
public protocol DataConvertible {
    typealias Result
    
    class func convertFromData(data:NSData) -> Result?
}

public protocol DataRepresentable {
    func asData() -> NSData!
}
```

---

# E.g., support for `NSDictionary`

```Swift
extension NSDictionary : DataConvertible, DataRepresentable {
    public typealias Result = NSDictionary
    
    public class func convertFromData(data:NSData) -> Result? {
        return NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveObjectWithData(data) 
        	as? NSDictionary
    }
    
    public func asData() -> NSData! {
        return NSKeyedArchiver.archivedDataWithRootObject(self)
    }
}
```

---

Then creating a `NSDictionary` cache would be as simple as:

```swift
let cache = Cache<NSDictionary>(name: "dictionaries")
```

---

# Current efforts

* Format dependencies
* Cache expiration
* Documentation
* Preloading
